## The Problem with Manual Diagrams

Architecture diagrams are essential for understanding complex systems, onboarding new team members, and planning new features. But they have a fatal flaw: they are almost always out of date. Manually created diagrams in tools like Visio or Lucidchart quickly become stale as your system evolves, making them misleading and untrustworthy.

Our **System Architecture Visualizer** solves this problem by generating diagrams directly from the source of truth: your code and your live cloud environment.

## What is a System Architecture Visualizer?

A System Architecture Visualizer is a "diagram as code" tool that automatically discovers and maps out the components of your system. It can scan your cloud provider account (like AWS, GCP, or Azure) to visualize your infrastructure, or it can analyze your codebase to map out dependencies between services, modules, and classes. The result is an interactive, always-up-to-date diagram that reflects the actual state of your system.

## A Common Use Case: Onboarding a New Engineer

A new engineer is joining your team. They need to understand how your application, which is deployed on AWS, is structured.

1.  **Generate the Diagram:** Instead of showing them an outdated diagram from 6 months ago, you run the visualizer.
    *   `visualizer --provider aws --region us-east-1`

2.  **Automated Discovery:**
    *   The tool connects to your AWS account with read-only credentials.
    *   It scans your VPCs, EC2 instances, RDS databases, S3 buckets, and the connections between them.
    *   Within minutes, it generates a detailed, interactive diagram.

3.  **Explore the System:** The new engineer opens the generated diagram in their browser.
    *   They can see the public load balancer, the web server auto-scaling group, the application servers, and the connection to the RDS database.
    *   They click on an EC2 instance to see its instance type, security groups, and attached volumes.
    *   They filter the view to see only the resources related to the "payments" service.

4.  **Integrate with CI/CD:** You configure a CI job to run the visualizer every night and publish the updated diagram to your internal wiki. Now, your entire team always has access to a current view of your infrastructure.

5.  **Result:** The new engineer gains a deep understanding of the system's architecture in a fraction of the time it would have taken with static documentation. The team has a reliable, single source of truth for how their system is actually deployed.
