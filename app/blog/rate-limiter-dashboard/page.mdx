## Is Your API Vulnerable to Abuse?

Publicly exposed APIs are powerful, but they are also vulnerable. A single misbehaving script or a malicious actor can flood your API with requests, overwhelming your servers, degrading performance for legitimate users, and driving up your costs. Protecting your API from such abuse is not just a good practice—it's a necessity.

Our **Rate Limiter Dashboard** is a powerful tool that acts as a gatekeeper for your API. It allows you to define and enforce usage policies, monitor traffic in real-time, and automatically block abusive clients, ensuring your API remains stable, available, and fair for everyone.

## What is a Rate Limiter?

A rate limiter is a system that controls the amount of incoming traffic to a server or API. It works by tracking the number of requests a client makes within a specific time window and blocking them if they exceed a pre-defined limit. This is a critical defense against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and ensures that no single user can monopolize server resources.

Our dashboard provides an intuitive interface to configure and monitor these rate-limiting rules.

## A Common Use Case: Protecting a Public API

You run a SaaS product with a public API that has different tiers of access: Free, Pro, and Enterprise.

1.  **Define Rate Limiting Tiers:** In the Rate Limiter Dashboard, you create three different rules:
    *   **Free Tier:** A rule linked to API keys for free users, limiting them to 20 requests per minute.
    *   **Pro Tier:** A rule for pro users, allowing 100 requests per minute.
    *   **Global Login Limit:** A general rule to protect your `POST /login` endpoint, limiting requests from any single IP address to 5 per minute to prevent brute-force attacks.
2.  **Monitor Usage:** A user on the free plan runs a script that accidentally enters an infinite loop, sending hundreds of requests to your API.
3.  **Automatic Protection:**
    *   The Rate Limiter detects the spike in requests from the user's API key.
    *   After the 20th request in a minute, it begins to automatically block subsequent requests from that key with a `429` error.
    *   The dashboard sends you an alert about the unusual activity.
4.  **Result:** Your API's performance is unaffected for all other users. The misbehaving script is contained, and your servers remain healthy. You can then reach out to the user to help them fix their script.
