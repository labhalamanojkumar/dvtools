## The Jungle of Code Quality Tools

In a modern software project, you might be using ESLint for JavaScript style, Prettier for formatting, a security scanner for vulnerabilities, and a complexity checker for code metrics. Each tool has its own configuration file, its own command-line interface, and its own output format. Running them all becomes a chore, and integrating them into your CI/CD pipeline is a complex task.

Our **Static Analysis Runner** is a unified interface for all your code quality tools. It allows you to configure, run, and view the results of multiple analyzers with a single, simple workflow.

## What is a Static Analysis Runner?

A Static Analysis Runner is a tool that orchestrates the execution of various static analysis tools. You define a single configuration file specifying which tools to run, on which files, and with which settings. The runner then executes them—often in parallel—and aggregates their output into a single, easy-to-read report. It simplifies your development workflow and your CI/CD setup.

## A Common Use Case: A Polyglot Monorepo

You manage a large monorepo containing a React frontend, a Node.js backend, and some Python scripts for data processing.

1.  **Configure the Runner:** You create a single `.analysis-runner.yml` file at the root of your repository.

    ```yaml
    tools:
      - name: eslint
        command: eslint
        files: "packages/frontend/src/**/*.{js,ts,tsx}"
      - name: prettier
        command: prettier --check
        files: "**/*.{js,ts,tsx,json,md}"
      - name: bandit
        command: bandit -r
        files: "packages/data-scripts/"
    ```

2.  **Run Locally:** A developer makes some changes and wants to check for issues before committing. They run a single command:
    *   `analysis-runner run`

3.  **Automated Execution:**
    *   The runner spins up three parallel processes.
    *   It runs ESLint on the frontend code, Prettier on all relevant files, and Bandit (a Python security linter) on the scripts directory.
    *   It collects the output from all three tools.

4.  **Consolidated Output:** The developer sees a single report in their terminal:

    ```
    [eslint] packages/frontend/src/components/User.tsx:10:5: Unused variable 'user'
    [prettier] packages/frontend/src/App.tsx: Code is not formatted
    [bandit] packages/data-scripts/process.py: High-confidence issue: Use of subprocess without shell=True

    Found 3 issues from 3 tools.
    ```

5.  **CI Integration:** In your CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions), you have a single step: `analysis-runner run`. If any tool reports an error, the build fails, preventing low-quality code from being merged.
