## The Danger of Stale Secrets

How old is your database password? If it's been the same for months—or years—it's a major security risk. Long-lived credentials, whether they are API keys, passwords, or certificates, are a prime target for attackers. A single leaked key that is never changed can provide an attacker with indefinite access to your systems.

Manually rotating secrets is a tedious and error-prone process that is often neglected. Our **Secrets Rotation Scheduler** automates this critical security task, ensuring your credentials are changed regularly without any manual intervention.

## What is a Secrets Rotation Scheduler?

A Secrets Rotation Scheduler is a tool that automatically changes secrets on a predefined schedule. It integrates with various services (like databases, cloud providers, and third-party APIs) to perform a multi-step rotation process:
1.  Create a new version of the secret (e.g., a new password).
2.  Update the service (e.g., the database user) with the new secret.
3.  Update the secret management system (like our Secrets Vault) with the new value.
4.  (Optionally) Deactivate the old secret after a grace period.

This ensures that your applications can seamlessly switch to the new credential with zero downtime.

## A Common Use Case: Rotating a Database Password

You have a production web application that connects to a PostgreSQL database. You want to rotate the database password every 90 days to comply with your security policy.

1.  **Create a Rotation Schedule:** In the Secrets Rotation Scheduler, you create a new job.
    *   **Secret to Rotate:** You select the `prod/database/password` secret stored in your vault.
    *   **Rotation Lambda:** You choose the built-in `postgresql-password` rotation function.
    *   **Schedule:** You set it to run every 90 days.

2.  **The Rotation Process:** On the scheduled day, the scheduler automatically executes the following steps:
    *   It fetches the current database connection details and the master credentials (which are themselves stored securely).
    *   It generates a new, strong, random password.
    *   It connects to the PostgreSQL server and runs an `ALTER USER` command to change the password for your application's user.
    *   It updates the `prod/database/password` secret in the vault with the new password.
    *   It verifies that the new password works.

3.  **Zero Downtime for Your Application:** Your application is configured to periodically re-fetch the database password from the vault. The next time it does, it will retrieve the new password and automatically start using it to establish new connections. Existing connections are not affected.

4.  **Result:** The database password has been changed without any manual effort, without any application downtime, and without anyone ever needing to see the new password. Your security posture is significantly improved.

## Set It and Forget It Security

Automated secrets rotation is a cornerstone of modern, proactive security. It's a high-impact, low-effort way to protect your most sensitive assets. Stop letting your credentials become stale and vulnerable.
