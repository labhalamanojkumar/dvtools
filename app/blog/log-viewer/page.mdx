## Drowning in a Sea of Text

Logs are the lifeblood of any application. They tell the story of what's happening under the hood, from routine operations to critical errors. But when you're faced with a raw log file containing thousands of lines of dense text, finding the information you need can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack.

Our **Log Viewer** is a powerful online tool designed to transform messy log files into a structured, searchable, and analyzable format. It helps you make sense of your logs so you can debug issues faster.

## From Raw Text to Actionable Insights

The Log Viewer is built to handle both structured logs (like JSON) and unstructured plain text, providing a suite of features to help you drill down to the important events.

## A Typical Debugging Workflow

Imagine your application is experiencing intermittent errors. You've downloaded the log file from your server.

1.  **Load the Logs:** Open the Log Viewer and paste the contents of your log file into the tool.
2.  **Initial Scan:** The logs are immediately parsed and color-coded. You can quickly scroll to see if there are any obvious red `ERROR` or `FATAL` entries.
3.  **Filter for Errors:** Use the filter bar to narrow the view. A good first step is to filter by `level:ERROR`. This hides all the noise and shows you only the error messages.
4.  **Trace a Request:** Find an error and identify a unique identifier, like a `traceId` or `requestId`. Copy this ID.
5.  **Clear Filters and Search:** Clear the level filter and paste the `traceId` into the main search bar. The viewer will now show you every log entry related to that specific request, from the moment it entered the system to the point where it failed. This gives you the complete context to understand what went wrong.
