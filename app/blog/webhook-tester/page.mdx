## The Black Box of Webhooks

Webhooks are a powerful way for applications to send real-time data to each other. Services like Stripe, GitHub, and Slack use webhooks to notify your application about events, like a new payment, a git push, or a new message. However, developing and debugging webhooks can be challenging. They are HTTP requests sent *to* your application, which means you need a publicly accessible URL to receive them, even during development.

Our **Webhook Tester** solves this problem by giving you a unique, temporary URL that can receive any HTTP request. It acts as a "request catcher," allowing you to see exactly what a service is sending you, inspect the headers and body, and debug your integration without exposing your local development machine to the internet.

## What is a Webhook Tester?

A webhook tester is an online tool that generates a unique, public URL for you to use. Any HTTP request sent to this URL is captured and displayed in real-time in the tester's interface. You can inspect every detail of the request, including the HTTP method, headers, query parameters, and the raw body content. It's an indispensable tool for anyone working with webhook integrations.

## A Common Use Case: Integrating a GitHub Webhook

You want to build an application that automatically deploys when you push to your GitHub repository's `main` branch.

1.  **Generate a Test URL:** Go to the Webhook Tester and generate a new unique URL.
2.  **Configure the Webhook in GitHub:** In your GitHub repository's settings, go to "Webhooks" and add a new webhook.
    *   **Payload URL:** Paste the URL you got from the Webhook Tester.
    *   **Content type:** `application/json`
    *   **Events:** Select "Just the `push` event."
3.  **Trigger the Webhook:** Now, make a commit and push it to your `main` branch.
4.  **Inspect the Request:** Go back to the Webhook Tester. You will see a new `POST` request that has just arrived. Click on it to expand the details. You can now see the exact JSON payload that GitHub sends for a push event, including the repository name, commit details, and author information.
5.  **Build Your Application:** With this knowledge, you can now build your actual application logic. You know exactly what the JSON structure looks like and what fields you need to parse to get the information you need.
