## From Theory to Practice: Execute SQL Instantly

Learning SQL or testing a complex query often requires connecting to a live database, which can be a slow and cumbersome process. You might need to install a database client, configure connection strings, and worry about affecting production data. What if you just want a quick and easy way to run a query and see the results?

Our **SQL Query Runner** provides a live, interactive sandbox where you can write and execute SQL queries directly in your browser. It's the perfect environment for practicing your SQL skills, testing logic, and validating statements without any setup.

## What is an SQL Query Runner?

An SQL query runner is an online tool that provides a ready-to-use database environment. It consists of a text editor for writing your queries and a results panel to display the output. You can run `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements against a pre-populated sample database, giving you immediate feedback on your code.

## A Common Use Case: Practicing a `JOIN`

Let's say you're learning how to join tables and want to find all orders placed by a specific customer.

1.  **Explore the Schema:** Use the schema explorer to see the `customers` and `orders` tables. Note that they can be joined on `customers.id` and `orders.customer_id`.
2.  **Write Your Query:** In the SQL editor, write your `JOIN` statement:
    ```sql
    SELECT
      c.name,
      o.order_date,
      o.total_amount
    FROM
      customers c
      JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
    WHERE
      c.name = 'John Smith';
    ```
3.  **Execute and Analyze:** Click "Run Query". The results table will populate with the order date and total amount for all orders placed by John Smith. You can now experiment further by changing the customer name, adding more `JOIN`s, or using aggregate functions like `SUM()`.
