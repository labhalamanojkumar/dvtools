## See Through Your Users' Eyes

When a customer reports a problem, one of the hardest parts of debugging is trying to reproduce the issue. You can ask for screenshots and descriptions, but nothing is more effective than seeing the application exactly as the user sees it. However, asking for a user's password is a massive security risk and should never be done.

Our **User Impersonation Console** provides a secure solution. It allows authorized administrators and support staff to temporarily "log in as" another user to view the application from their perspective. This is done without ever needing or exposing the user's actual password, providing a powerful and secure way to troubleshoot customer issues.

## What is User Impersonation?

User impersonation is a feature that allows a privileged user (like an admin) to assume the identity of another user within an application. The system generates a temporary, secure session for the admin that has all the permissions and data access of the target user. This allows the admin to navigate the app, see the user's data, and replicate their actions to diagnose problems effectively.

## A Common Use Case: Debugging a Customer's Dashboard

A customer writes in saying that a chart on their dashboard is not loading correctly, but it works fine for you.

1.  **Find the User:** In the User Impersonation Console, search for the customer by their email or user ID.
2.  **Initiate Impersonation:** Click the "Impersonate" button next to their name. You will be asked to confirm and may need to provide a reason for the audit log.
3.  **View as the User:** Your view of the application will instantly refresh, and you will now be navigating the app as if you were logged in as that customer. You'll see a clear banner at the top of the screen indicating that you are in an impersonation session.
4.  **Reproduce the Bug:** Navigate to the customer's dashboard. You now see the broken chart exactly as they described it. By using the browser's developer tools, you discover that the chart is failing because of a specific data configuration unique to that user's account.
5.  **End the Session:** Once you've identified the problem, you can end the impersonation session with a single click and return to your own admin account. You now have all the information you need to fix the bug.
