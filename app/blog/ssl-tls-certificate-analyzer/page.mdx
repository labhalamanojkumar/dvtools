## Is Your Website's Connection Secure?

In today's web, a valid SSL/TLS certificate is non-negotiable. It's the padlock in the address bar that tells your visitors their connection is encrypted and your site is trustworthy. However, SSL certificates can expire, be misconfigured, or have incomplete trust chains, leading to scary browser warnings that drive users away.

Our **SSL/TLS Certificate Analyzer** is a simple tool that allows you to instantly check the SSL certificate of any domain. It provides a detailed breakdown of the certificate's properties, helping you verify its validity, diagnose issues, and ensure your website's connection is secure.

## What is an SSL/TLS Certificate Analyzer?

An SSL/TLS certificate analyzer is a tool that connects to a web server, retrieves its SSL certificate, and displays all the relevant information in a human-readable format. It's like looking at the ID card of a website, allowing you to verify its identity, the issuing authority, and the expiration date, all in one place.

## A Common Use Case: Debugging an SSL Warning

Imagine you've just deployed a new SSL certificate, but users are reporting a browser warning like "Your connection is not private".

1.  **Enter Your Domain:** Go to the SSL/TLS Certificate Analyzer and type in your website's domain (e.g., `www.your-site.com`).
2.  **Analyze the Results:** The tool will fetch the certificate and display its details.
3.  **Identify the Problem:** You might discover one of several common issues:
    *   **Name Mismatch:** The certificate was issued for `your-site.com`, but users are visiting `www.your-site.com`, which isn't listed as a Subject Alternative Name (SAN).
    *   **Expired Certificate:** The certificate's "Valid To" date is in the past.
    *   **Incomplete Chain:** The server isn't providing the necessary intermediate certificates, so the browser can't link it back to a trusted root CA.
4.  **Fix the Issue:** With this specific information, you can now take the correct action, whether it's reissuing the certificate with the correct names or configuring your server to send the full certificate chain.
