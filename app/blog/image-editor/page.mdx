## The High Cost of Unoptimized Images

Large, unoptimized images are one of the biggest culprits behind slow-loading websites. They consume bandwidth, increase page load times, and lead to a poor user experience, which can negatively impact your SEO rankings and conversion rates. Manually optimizing images with desktop software is slow and cumbersome.

Our suite of **Image Tools** provides a fast, free, and browser-based solution. It combines an **Image Editor**, **Optimizer**, and **Converter** into one seamless workflow, helping you prepare web-ready images in seconds.

## A Trio of Tools for Perfect Images

Our image utility is designed to handle the most common image-related tasks for web development without ever leaving your browser.

## The Modern Workflow for Web Images

1.  **Upload:** Drag and drop your high-resolution image(s) into the tool.
2.  **Edit (Optional):** If needed, use the editor to crop the image to a 16:9 banner or resize it to a maximum width of 1200 pixels.
3.  **Optimize & Convert:**
    *   Select your target format. For most web use cases, **WebP** is an excellent choice, offering a great balance of quality and size. For maximum compression, try **AVIF**.
    *   Adjust the quality slider. The tool will show you the original and optimized file sizes in real-time. Find the sweet spot where the quality is still excellent, but the file size is significantly smaller.
4.  **Download:** Download your perfectly optimized, web-ready image. If you uploaded a batch, you can download all the converted images in a single ZIP file.
