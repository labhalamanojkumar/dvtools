## Your Website's First Line of Defense

As a web developer, you know that security is not just a backend concern. Many of the most common web attacks, like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and clickjacking, target the front-end of your application. Fortunately, modern browsers support a powerful set of defenses you can enable: **HTTP Security Headers**.

Among these, the **Content Security Policy (CSP)** is the most critical. Our free **CSP & Security Headers Tester** is an online tool that analyzes any website's headers and gives you an instant report on its security posture.

## What is a Content Security Policy (CSP)?

CSP is an HTTP response header that tells the browser which resources (scripts, styles, images, etc.) are safe to load on your page. It acts as a whitelist. If a resource isn't on the list, the browser will block it.

This is a game-changer for preventing XSS attacks. If a malicious actor manages to inject an unauthorized script into your page, a strong CSP will prevent the browser from executing it.

A simple CSP might look like this:
`Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://apis.google.com;`

This policy says:
-   By default, only load resources from my own domain (`'self'`).
-   For scripts, allow them from my own domain AND from `https://apis.google.com`.

## How to Use Our Security Headers Tester

It couldn't be simpler.

1.  **Enter a URL:** Type or paste the full URL of the website you want to analyze (e.g., `https://yourwebsite.com`).
2.  **Run the Test:** Click the "Test" button.
3.  **Review Your Report:** Our tool will make a request to the URL, inspect the HTTP response headers, and provide a detailed report. It will show you:
    *   Which security headers are present and which are missing.
    *   A breakdown of your Content Security Policy directives.
    *   Warnings for common misconfigurations or unsafe values (like `unsafe-inline`).
    *   Recommendations for improvement with links to learn more.

## Implementing Security Headers

Security headers are typically set at the web server (Nginx, Apache) or application level (e.g., via middleware in a Node.js/Express app).

**Example in Nginx:**
```nginx
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self';";
add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
```

## Take Control of Your Front-End Security

Implementing strong security headers is one of the most effective and low-cost ways to dramatically improve your website's resilience against common attacks.
