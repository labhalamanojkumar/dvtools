## The Pain of Opening Large Data Files

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) and Excel files are the workhorses of data exchange. But trying to open a large file—one with hundreds of thousands or millions of rows—can bring desktop applications like Microsoft Excel or Apple Numbers to a grinding halt. You're left waiting, staring at a loading spinner, just to take a quick look at the data.

Our free **CSV & Excel Inspector** is a browser-based tool designed to solve this problem. It lets you instantly open and inspect massive tabular data files without crashing or even leaving your browser.

## What is a Data Inspector?

A data inspector is a lightweight tool optimized for one purpose: quickly viewing and searching data. Unlike full-featured spreadsheet programs, it doesn't load the entire file into memory at once. Instead, it intelligently streams the data, allowing you to start exploring immediately.

## How to Use the CSV & Excel Inspector

1.  **Drag and Drop Your File:** Open the tool and drag your CSV or Excel file onto the page.
2.  **Start Exploring:** The data will appear in a clean, tabular format. You can scroll through the rows and columns.
3.  **Search and Filter:** Use the main search bar to find text anywhere in the file. Click the filter icon in a column header to apply a filter specific to that column's data.
4.  **Analyze:** Check the column statistics to get a high-level understanding of the dataset's structure and completeness.
