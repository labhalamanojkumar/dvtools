## Drowning in a Sea of Issues?

For any successful software project, a steady stream of incoming issues, bug reports, and feature requests is a sign of an engaged user base. However, this influx can quickly become overwhelming. Without a systematic process, important issues can get lost, duplicates can clog up the backlog, and developers can be left unsure of what to work on next.

Our **Issue Triage Board** is a project management tool designed specifically to solve this problem. It provides a centralized, Kanban-style interface to help you efficiently review, prioritize, and delegate incoming issues from all your sources.

## What is an Issue Triage Board?

"Triage" is the process of sorting and prioritizing incoming items based on their urgency and importance. An Issue Triage Board is a tool that facilitates this process for software development issues. It pulls in new, untriaged issues from platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Jira, and presents them in a way that makes it easy for a project manager or lead developer to make quick decisions about each one.

## A Common Use Case: Weekly Triage Meeting

You are the lead for a popular open-source project on GitHub. Your team holds a 30-minute triage meeting every Monday to process the issues that came in over the week.

1.  **Open the Board:** The team gathers and opens the Issue Triage Board, which is already populated with all the new, untriaged issues from the project's repository.
2.  **Review the First Issue:** The first issue is a bug report about a login problem.
    *   **Action:** The team lead confirms it's a valid bug, labels it as `bug` and `p1-critical`, and assigns it to the developer who is most familiar with the auth system. The card for the issue automatically moves from the "Triage" column to the "Backlog" column.
3.  **Review the Second Issue:** The next issue is a feature request for a new theme.
    *   **Action:** The team decides it's a good idea but not a priority. They label it `feature-request` and `p3-nice-to-have`. They leave it unassigned for now.
4.  **Review a Duplicate Issue:** The third issue is a report of a known bug that has already been filed.
    *   **Action:** The lead uses a saved reply to post a comment thanking the user and linking to the original issue, and then closes the new issue as a duplicate.
5.  **Continue the Process:** The team continues this process, and within 30 minutes, the "Triage" column is empty. The backlog is neatly organized, and every developer knows their priorities for the week.
