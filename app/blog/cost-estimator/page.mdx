## Planning Your Cloud Architecture? Don't Forget the Cost.

Choosing the right services for your application on AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud is a complex decision. While performance and scalability are key considerations, cost is an equally critical factor that can make or break your project's budget. Cloud provider pricing is notoriously complex, with countless variables for each service.

Our **Cost Estimator** is a FinOps tool designed to simplify this process. It provides a user-friendly interface to model your desired architecture and get a clear, detailed estimate of your monthly cloud spending before you write a single line of infrastructure code.

## What is a Cost Estimator?

A Cost Estimator is a tool that helps you forecast the expenses associated with using cloud services. You can select the services you plan to use (e.g., virtual machines, databases, storage), configure their specifications (e.g., size, region, usage), and the tool will calculate the projected monthly cost based on the latest pricing data from the cloud providers.

## A Common Use Case: Planning a New Web Application

You are designing the architecture for a new web application and need to estimate its monthly hosting costs on AWS. You anticipate needing the following services:
*   A load balancer
*   Two web server instances
*   A managed PostgreSQL database
*   Object storage for user uploads

1.  **Create a New Estimate:** You start a new estimate and name it "My Web App - AWS."
2.  **Add and Configure Services:**
    *   **Load Balancer:** You add an "Application Load Balancer" and estimate the number of processed bytes.
    *   **Web Servers:** You add two "EC2 Instances." You choose the `t4g.medium` instance type in the `us-east-1` region.
    *   **Database:** You add an "RDS for PostgreSQL" instance, selecting a `db.t4g.small` instance with 100 GB of storage.
    *   **Storage:** You add "S3 Standard" storage and estimate 500 GB of stored data.
3.  **Review the Estimate:** The Cost Estimator instantly calculates the total projected cost, providing a monthly summary:
    *   Application Load Balancer: ~$25
    *   EC2 Instances (2): ~$50
    *   RDS Database: ~$30
    *   S3 Storage: ~$12
    *   **Total Estimated Monthly Cost: ~$117**
4.  **Optimize:** You notice that choosing a 1-year reserved plan for your EC2 and RDS instances could reduce their cost by 30%. You adjust the settings and see the total estimate drop to under $95.

## Design for Cost from Day One

Cloud cost management (FinOps) is not just about monitoring bills; it's about making smart decisions before you even start. Our Cost Estimator empowers you to build cost-aware architectures from the ground up.
