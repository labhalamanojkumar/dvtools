## The World of Delimited Text Files

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) and TSV (Tab-Separated Values) are simple, powerful formats for storing tabular data in plain text. While they seem similar, the choice of delimiter—a comma versus a tab—has significant implications for data integrity and ease of parsing.

Our free **CSV/TSV Encoder & Decoder** is a smart tool that helps you reliably convert data into these formats and switch between them, correctly handling tricky edge cases like quotes and embedded delimiters.

## CSV vs. TSV: What's the Difference?

**CSV (Comma-Separated Values):**
-   **Delimiter:** Comma (`,`)
-   **Strength:** Extremely common and widely supported.
-   **Weakness:** Commas are often present within data fields themselves (e.g., "New York, NY"). This requires fields to be enclosed in quotes (`"`) to avoid ambiguity, making parsing more complex.
    -   Example: `1,"Doe, John",New York`

**TSV (Tab-Separated Values):**
-   **Delimiter:** Tab (`\t`)
-   **Strength:** Tabs are very rare in actual data. This means you usually don't need to worry about quoting fields, making the format simpler and more robust.
-   **Weakness:** Less common than CSV. Some tools might not support it as a default import option.
    -   Example: `1  Doe, John  New York` (where the space is a tab)

The official standard for CSV, RFC 4180, specifies how to handle quotes and newlines, but not all programs follow it perfectly. This is why a reliable encoder/decoder is so important.

## How to Use the CSV/TSV Encoder & Decoder

1.  **Choose Your Input:** You can start with raw data (like JSON) to encode, or paste existing CSV/TSV data to decode or convert.
2.  **Select Your Target Format:** Choose whether you want the output to be CSV or TSV.
3.  **Encode/Decode:**
    *   If **encoding from JSON**, the tool will generate a valid CSV or TSV file, adding quotes where necessary.
    *   If **converting from CSV to TSV**, it will parse the CSV, remove the quotes, and create a clean TSV.
    *   If **converting from TSV to CSV**, it will analyze the data and add quotes to any fields that contain commas to ensure the CSV is valid.
4.  **Copy the Result:** Your perfectly formatted output is ready to be copied and saved.

## Choose the Right Format for the Job

-   Use **CSV** when you need maximum compatibility with other tools.
-   Use **TSV** when you want a simpler, more robust format that is easier to parse, especially with command-line tools.

Our encoder/decoder gives you the flexibility to work with both, ensuring your data is always structured correctly.
