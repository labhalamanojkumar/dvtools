## Why Web Accessibility is Non-Negotiable

In the digital age, the web should be for everyone. Web accessibility (often abbreviated as **a11y**) is the practice of ensuring that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. This includes individuals with auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual impairments.

But accessibility isn't just about compliance or social responsibility—it's a cornerstone of good design and smart business. An accessible website often leads to:
*   **Better SEO:** Search engines favor well-structured, semantic HTML.
*   **Improved User Experience:** Clear navigation and readable content benefit all users.
*   **Wider Audience Reach:** Don't exclude 15% of the world's population.
*   **Reduced Legal Risk:** Avoid costly lawsuits by complying with standards like WCAG and ADA.

Our **Accessibility Scanner** is a free, powerful tool designed to help you quickly audit your website and identify critical accessibility issues.

## Introducing the Accessibility Scanner

The Accessibility Scanner is an automated tool that crawls a given URL and flags common accessibility violations. It provides a detailed report with actionable feedback, allowing you to pinpoint and fix issues without needing to be an accessibility expert.

## How to Use the Accessibility Scanner

Auditing your site takes less than a minute.

1.  **Navigate to the Tool:** Open the **Accessibility Scanner** from our tools directory.
2.  **Enter a URL:** Input the full URL of the webpage you want to analyze.
3.  **Run the Scan:** Click the "Scan" button. The tool will begin to crawl the page and analyze its DOM.
4.  **Review the Report:** The scanner will generate a comprehensive report categorizing issues by severity (Critical, Serious, Moderate). Each issue includes a description, the offending code snippet, and a recommendation for how to fix it.
5.  **Fix and Re-scan:** Implement the suggested fixes in your code and run the scan again to verify that the issues have been resolved.

## Make Accessibility a Priority

Automated tools like our Accessibility Scanner are a great first step, but they can't catch everything. Manual testing, such as navigating with a keyboard and using a screen reader, is also essential for a truly inclusive experience.

Make accessibility a core part of your development process, not an afterthought.

<div className="text-center my-10">
  <Button asChild size="lg">
    <Link href="/tools/accessibility-scanner">
      <Search className="mr-2 h-5 w-5" /> Scan Your Website Now
    </Link>
  </Button>
</div>

Start building a more accessible web today. It's better for people, and it's better for business.
