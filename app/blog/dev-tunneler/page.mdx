## The "It Works on My Machine" Problem

You're developing a new feature on your local machine. It works perfectly on `http://localhost:3000`. But now you need to:
-   Test a webhook from a third-party service like Stripe or GitHub.
-   Show a quick demo to a colleague or client who isn't in the same room.
-   Test your site on a real mobile device over the internet.

Your `localhost` is a private island, inaccessible to the outside world. A **Dev Tunneler** is the bridge that connects your island to the mainland. It creates a secure public URL that tunnels traffic directly to your local development server.

## What is a Dev Tunneler?

A Dev Tunneler, like the popular tool `ngrok`, is a reverse proxy service. It creates a secure connection from your local machine to a public server. This public server then provides a temporary, publicly accessible URL (e.g., `https://random-name.our-tunneler.com`). When someone accesses this public URL, the tunneler forwards the request through the secure connection to your `localhost`.

Our **Dev Tunneler** is a free, easy-to-use online tool that gets you a public URL in seconds without any command-line hassle.

## How to Use the Dev Tunneler

1.  **Start Your Local Server:** Make sure your local development server is running (e.g., `npm run dev`). Note the port it's using (e.g., `3000`).
2.  **Open the Dev Tunneler Tool:** Navigate to the tool on our platform.
3.  **Enter Your Local Port:** Type your local port number (`3000`) into the input field.
4.  **Start the Tunnel:** Click the "Start Tunnel" button. The tool will establish the connection and provide you with your unique public URL.
5.  **Share and Test:** Use this URL anywhere you need. Give it to your colleague, paste it into your webhook provider's settings, or open it on your phone. All requests will be securely forwarded to your local machine.

    <CardContent>
      <p>This is the most common use case. Services like Stripe need to send events to your server. You can't give them `localhost:3000`. With the tunneler, you give them your public URL, and you can develop and debug your webhook handler in real-time.</p>

## A Must-Have for Modern Web Development

A dev tunneler is an essential utility that solves a fundamental problem in web development. It bridges the gap between your local environment and the public internet, enabling a whole new range of testing and collaboration workflows.

<div className="text-center my-10">
  <Button asChild size="lg">
    <Link href="/tools/dev-tunneler">
      <Zap className="mr-2 h-5 w-5" /> Start Your Tunnel Now
    </Link>
  </Button>
</div>

Stop saying "it works on my machine" and start sharing your work with the world, one tunnel at a time.
