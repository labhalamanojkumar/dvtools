## Don't Wait for the Backend to Be Ready

One of the biggest bottlenecks in modern development is the dependency between frontend and backend teams. Frontend developers are often blocked, waiting for the backend API to be built and deployed before they can start working on UI components that fetch and display data.

Our **Mock Server** is a tool designed to eliminate this bottleneck. It allows you to create a fully functional, fake API in minutes. You can define your own endpoints, specify the exact JSON responses they should return, and get a live URL to use in your frontend application for development and testing.

## What is a Mock Server?

A Mock Server is a simulated API server that returns pre-defined responses to HTTP requests. Instead of containing real business logic, it simply listens for requests on specific endpoints and sends back the data you've configured. This allows frontend developers to build and test their applications against a stable, predictable API without needing a live backend.

## A Common Use Case: Building a User Profile Page

You are a frontend developer tasked with building a user profile page in a React application. The backend team has given you the API contract, but the actual API won't be ready for another week.

1.  **Create a Mock Server:** You open the Mock Server tool and create a new API. It gives you a base URL like `https://mock.maltitool.dev/xyz123`.
2.  **Define the Endpoint:** The API contract says you need to fetch user data from `GET /users/:id`. You create a new endpoint in the mock server:
    *   **Method:** `GET`
    *   **Path:** `/users/:id`
    *   **Response Body:** You paste the example JSON response from the API contract:
        ```json
        {
          "id": "1",
          "name": "John Doe",
          "email": "john.doe@example.com",
          "avatarUrl": "https://i.pravatar.cc/150"
        }
        ```
3.  **Develop the Frontend:** In your React code, you set your API base URL to `https://mock.maltitool.dev/xyz123`. You can now write your data-fetching logic and build the entire profile page component, using the mock API to get the data.
4.  **Test Edge Cases:** You want to test how your UI handles a user not being found. You create another endpoint:
    *   **Method:** `GET`
    *   **Path:** `/users/notfound`
    *   **Status Code:** `404`
    *   **Response Body:** `{ "error": "User not found" }`
    You can now test your error handling logic in the UI.

When the real backend is ready, all you need to do is change the base URL in your application. The rest of your code works without any changes.
