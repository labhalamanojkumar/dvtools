## The Need for a Quick SQL Client

Sometimes you just need to run a quick `SELECT` statement to check a value in your database. But firing up a heavy desktop SQL client like DBeaver or pgAdmin can be slow and cumbersome. You have to find the right connection, open a new query tab, and wait for everything to load.

Our free **Database Query Runner** is a lightweight, browser-based SQL client that lets you securely connect to your database and start running queries in seconds. It's the perfect tool for quick data exploration, debugging, and validation.

## How Can a Browser-Based Tool Be Secure?

This is the most important question, and the answer lies in the architecture. Our Database Query Runner is **not** a simple web form that sends your credentials to our server. It uses a secure, hybrid model:

1.  **Secure Connection:** You provide your database credentials (host, user, password).
2.  **No Server-Side Storage:** These credentials are **never** stored on our servers. They are used to establish a direct, secure connection from our backend infrastructure to your database for the duration of your session.
3.  **Proxy Execution:** When you run a query, it is sent to our secure backend proxy, which then executes it on your database. The results are streamed back to you and displayed in the browser.

This model gives you the convenience of a web interface with the security of a trusted backend environment.

## How to Use the Database Query Runner

1.  **Select Your Database Type:** Choose PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.
2.  **Enter Connection Details:** Fill in the host, port, username, password, and database name. For security, it's highly recommended to connect to a read-only replica of your database if you only need to view data.
3.  **Connect:** The tool will attempt to establish a secure connection.
4.  **Write and Run Your Query:** Use the SQL editor to write your query. You can run the entire query or highlight a specific part to execute.
5.  **Analyze the Results:** The data will be displayed in the results panel below the editor. You can sort by columns or use the search bar to filter the results.
