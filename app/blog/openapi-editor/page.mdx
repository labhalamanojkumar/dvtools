## The Blueprint for Your REST APIs

In modern software development, a well-defined API contract is essential. The OpenAPI Specification (formerly known as Swagger) has become the industry standard for designing and documenting REST APIs. An OpenAPI document acts as a single source of truth that both humans and machines can understand, enabling better collaboration, automated testing, and code generation.

Our **OpenAPI Editor** is a powerful, web-based tool that makes it easy to write, visualize, and validate OpenAPI definitions. It's the perfect starting point for any API-first development workflow.

## What is an OpenAPI Editor?

An OpenAPI Editor is a specialized IDE for creating and editing API definitions in the OpenAPI format (usually written in YAML or JSON). It provides features like syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and real-time validation to help you write a valid and compliant specification. Crucially, it also generates interactive API documentation on the fly, allowing you to visualize what your API will look like to consumers.

## A Common Use Case: Designing a New "Products" API

You are a backend developer tasked with designing a new API for managing products in an e-commerce system.

1.  **Start with a Template:** You open the OpenAPI Editor, which provides a basic "Pet Store" example. You clear it out and start fresh.
2.  **Define the API Info:** You start by defining the basic information for your API, such as the title, version, and description.
3.  **Define a Path:** You want to create an endpoint to fetch a list of products. You add a new path: `/products`.
4.  **Define an Operation:** Under `/products`, you define a `get` operation.
    *   You add a `summary` and `description`.
    *   You define the `responses`. For a `200 OK` response, you specify that the content will be `application/json` and its `schema` will be an array of `Product` objects.
5.  **Define a Component Schema:** You realize you need to define what a `Product` looks like. You go to the `components/schemas` section and define the `Product` object with properties like `id` (integer), `name` (string), and `price` (number). The editor autocompletes the keywords for you.
6.  **Review and Validate:** As you work, the live preview on the right updates to show a beautiful documentation page for your `/products` endpoint. The validator alerts you that you forgot to add an `operationId`, which you quickly fix.
7.  **Share for Feedback:** Once you're happy with the design for all your endpoints (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT` etc.), you can share a link to the editor with your frontend team for feedback before you write any implementation code.

      <p>Use the OpenAPI definition as the contract. Once it's agreed upon, backend and frontend teams can work in parallel. The frontend team can use the definition to create a mock server, while the backend team works on the implementation.</p>
