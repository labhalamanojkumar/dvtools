## The First Line of Defense for Your APIs

In a world driven by interconnected services, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are the backbone of modern software. They power everything from mobile apps to complex microservice architectures. But with this connectivity comes a critical challenge: **security**. Unprotected APIs are open doors for data breaches, unauthorized access, and service abuse.

API keys are a fundamental mechanism for controlling access to your APIs. They act as a simple, effective gatekeeper, identifying the calling application and enabling you to monitor and control its usage. Our **API Key Manager** is a free, all-in-one tool designed to simplify every aspect of the API key lifecycle.

## What is the API Key Manager?

The API Key Manager is a powerful, client-side tool that helps you generate, manage, and validate API keys securely. It provides a centralized dashboard to handle API credentials for all your projects, ensuring you follow security best practices without the complexity.

## How to Manage Your API Keys Effectively

Here’s a simple workflow for using the API Key Manager:

1.  **Generate a New Key:**
    *   Open the **API Key Manager** tool.
    *   Click "Generate New Key".
    *   Assign it to a project or service (e.g., "Mobile App Backend").
    *   Add a prefix like `prod_` or `dev_` for easy identification.
    *   Set an expiration date for temporary keys (e.g., for a third-party integration trial).

2.  **Implement the Key:**
    *   Copy the generated key and store it securely in your application's environment variables.
    *   In your API middleware, add a check to validate the `x-api-key` header against your list of active keys.

3.  **Monitor Usage:**
    *   Periodically review the dashboard in the API Key Manager.
    *   Check the "Last Used" and "Request Count" columns to identify keys that are no longer in use or are being used excessively.

4.  **Rotate and Revoke:**
    *   **Rotation:** For long-lived keys, plan to rotate them regularly (e.g., every 90 days). Generate a new key, deploy it to your applications, and then revoke the old one after a transition period.
    *   **Revocation:** If a key is compromised or a service is decommissioned, immediately disable or delete the key from the manager to block all future access.
