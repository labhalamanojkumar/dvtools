## Is Your Application Truly Resilient?

In a perfect world, APIs are always available, networks are fast, and third-party scripts never fail. In the real world, this is rarely the case. A robust web application must be able to handle network failures, slow responses, and unavailable services gracefully. But how can you reliably test these failure scenarios during development?

Our **Request Blocker** tool is a powerful utility that acts as a local proxy, allowing you to selectively block or intercept HTTP/HTTPS requests made by your browser. This makes it easy to simulate various network conditions and test how your application behaves when certain resources are unavailable.

## What is a Request Blocker?

A request blocker is a development tool that gives you fine-grained control over the network requests your application makes. You can define rules to block requests to specific domains, URLs, or resource types. This is essential for testing loading states, error handling logic, and the overall resilience of your frontend.

## A Common Use Case: Testing API Failure

Imagine you have a dashboard that fetches data from `/api/v1/user-data`. What happens if that API endpoint goes down? Does your application show a helpful error message and a "retry" button, or does it crash with an unhandled exception?

1.  **Open the Request Blocker:** Launch the tool from our platform.
2.  **Define a Blocking Rule:** In the input field, add a new rule: `*/api/v1/user-data*`.
3.  **Choose the Action:** Select "Block with 503 Error".
4.  **Load Your Application:** Open your web application in a new tab. When your dashboard attempts to make the API call, the Request Blocker will intercept it and return a `503 Service Unavailable` status code.
5.  **Verify Behavior:** Your application should now display its API error state. You can verify that your error boundaries, user notifications, and retry logic all work as expected.

## Build More Robust and Reliable Applications

Testing for success is easy. The true mark of a professional-grade application is how it handles failure. The Request Blocker tool gives you the power to simulate real-world network problems, enabling you to build more resilient, reliable, and user-friendly applications.

</div>

Don't wait for your users to find your application's breaking points. Find and fix them yourself during development.
