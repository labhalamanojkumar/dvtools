## The Nightmare of Manual Schema Changes

"Did you remember to run the `ALTER TABLE` script on the staging server?"

This is a question that strikes fear into the hearts of developers. Managing database schema changes across different environments (development, testing, production) is notoriously difficult and risky. A missed script, a change applied in the wrong order, or a manual error can lead to application downtime, data corruption, and hours of painful debugging.

Our **Schema Migrator** tool brings the principles of version control to your database, transforming a chaotic process into a safe, automated, and reliable workflow.

## What is a Schema Migrator?

A Schema Migrator is a tool that allows you to define, version, and apply database schema changes in a structured and repeatable way. Instead of writing ad-hoc SQL scripts, you create individual migration files, each representing a single, incremental change to the schema. The migrator then tracks which migrations have been applied to which database and automatically brings any database up to date.

## A Common Use Case: Adding a New Feature

Your team is developing a new feature that requires adding a `last_login_at` column to the `users` table.

1.  **Create a Migration File:** A developer runs a command:
    *   `schema-migrator create add_last_login_to_users`
    *   This generates a new, timestamped SQL file (e.g., `20251208103000_add_last_login_to_users.sql`).

2.  **Define the Change:** The developer edits the file to define both the "up" (apply) and "down" (revert) migrations:

    ```sql
    -- migrate:up
    ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN last_login_at TIMESTAMP NULL;

    -- migrate:down
    ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN last_login_at;
    ```

3.  **Test Locally:** The developer runs the migrator against their local database to apply the change.
    *   `schema-migrator up`
    *   The tool connects to the database, sees that this migration hasn't been run, and executes the `ALTER TABLE` command. It records the migration version in a special `schema_migrations` table.

4.  **Commit and Deploy:** The migration file is committed to Git and pushed. When the code is deployed to staging and later to production, the CI/CD pipeline automatically runs the `schema-migrator up` command.

5.  **Result:** The `last_login_at` column is added to the `users` table in every environment, consistently and without any manual intervention. If the deployment fails and needs to be rolled back, the pipeline can run `schema-migrator down` to safely remove the column, returning the database to its previous state.

## Bring Sanity to Your Database Workflow

Stop treating your database schema as a fragile, manually-managed artifact. Embrace the power of automated, version-controlled migrations to build and deploy features faster and with greater confidence.
