## From Code to Cloud, Automatically

In modern software development, speed and reliability are paramount. Manually building, testing, and deploying code is slow, error-prone, and simply doesn't scale. This is where CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) comes in. A CI/CD pipeline automates the path your code takes from a developer's machine all the way to production.

Our **CI/CD Pipeline Editor** is a visual tool designed to take the complexity out of creating these pipelines. It allows you to define and visualize your entire software delivery process using a simple, drag-and-drop interface, abstracting away complex configuration files.

## What is a CI/CD Pipeline Editor?

A CI/CD pipeline editor is a tool that helps you define the stages of your software delivery lifecycle. This typically includes stages like:
*   **Build:** Compiling the code and creating artifacts (like a Docker image).
*   **Test:** Running automated tests (unit tests, integration tests, etc.).
*   **Deploy:** Pushing the code to a staging or production environment.

Our visual editor allows you to construct this workflow by connecting different steps or "jobs" together, defining how they run, and what triggers them (e.g., a push to the `main` branch).

## A Common Use Case: Automating a Web App Deployment

You have a Node.js web application in a GitHub repository and you want to automate its deployment to a cloud server.

1.  **Connect Your Repository:** In the CI/CD Pipeline Editor, connect to your GitHub account and select your repository.
2.  **Choose a Template:** Select the "Node.js Web App" template. This will create a basic pipeline with three stages: Build, Test, and Deploy.
3.  **Configure the Build Stage:** The "Build" stage might contain steps like `npm install` to install dependencies and `npm run build` to create a production build.
4.  **Configure the Test Stage:** The "Test" stage will run your automated tests with a command like `npm test`. You can configure the pipeline to only proceed to the Deploy stage if all tests pass.
5.  **Configure the Deploy Stage:** In the "Deploy" stage, you can add a step to `scp` (secure copy) your build files to your server or use a provider-specific CLI to deploy to services like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS. You'll use the secrets management feature to store your server's SSH key or your cloud provider's API token.
6.  **Activate the Pipeline:** Save and activate the pipeline. Now, every time you push a new commit to your `main` branch, this pipeline will automatically run, ensuring your latest code is built, tested, and deployed without any manual intervention.
