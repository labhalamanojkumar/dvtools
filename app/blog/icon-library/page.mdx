## How to Supercharge Your Workflow

1.  **Search:** Enter a keyword like "user," "settings," or "upload." The library will instantly display all matching icons from every set.
2.  **Customize:** Select an icon. Use the sidebar controls to match the icon's color to your brand's hex code and adjust its size and stroke to fit your design system.
3.  **Export:**
    *   **For Designers:** Click "Download SVG" to get a clean, optimized vector file to use in Figma, Sketch, or Illustrator.
    *   **For Developers:** Click "Copy JSX" (for React) or "Copy Vue" to get the icon as a ready-to-paste component, saving you from manual conversion.
