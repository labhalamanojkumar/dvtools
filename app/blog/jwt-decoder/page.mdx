## The Mystery of the Long, Encoded String

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are the backbone of modern authentication. They are compact, URL-safe strings that represent claims to be transferred between two parties. But when you're debugging, a JWT just looks like a long, meaningless jumble of characters separated by dots. How do you know what's inside? Is the user ID correct? Has the token expired?

Our **JWT Decoder** is a simple, secure, and powerful tool that lets you instantly peek inside any JWT, making debugging authentication flows a breeze.

## Anatomy of a JWT

A JWT consists of three parts, separated by dots (`.`):

1.  **Header:** Contains metadata about the token, such as the signing algorithm used (`alg`) and the token type (`typ`).
2.  **Payload:** Contains the "claims" or data about the user, such as their ID (`sub`), roles, and the token's expiration time (`exp`).
3.  **Signature:** A cryptographic signature used to verify that the token hasn't been tampered with.

Our JWT Decoder takes an encoded token and clearly separates and decodes the Header and Payload for easy inspection.

## Debugging Authentication in Seconds

Imagine a user is reporting they can't access a protected route. Here's how you'd use the JWT Decoder:

1.  **Get the Token:** Ask the user to provide the JWT they are using (usually found in local storage or an HTTP header).
2.  **Paste and Decode:** Paste the token into the decoder.
3.  **Inspect the Claims:**
    *   **Check the Expiration (`exp`):** The tool will tell you if the token has expired. This is the most common cause of access issues.
    *   **Verify User Info (`sub`, `email`, etc.):** Check that the user ID and other claims in the payload are correct.
    *   **Check Scopes/Roles:** If your application uses roles or permissions, verify that the token contains the correct ones for the route the user is trying to access.
4.  **Verify Signature (if needed):** If you suspect the token might be malformed or tampered with, you can paste your secret key to verify its integrity.
