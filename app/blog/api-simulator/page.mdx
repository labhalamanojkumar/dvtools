## The End of "I'm Blocked by the Backend"

In modern software development, the frontend and backend are often developed by different teams. This separation can create a significant bottleneck: the frontend team needs to consume APIs that the backend team hasn't finished building yet. The result? Delays, frustration, and inefficient workflows.

What if your frontend team could build and test against a fully functional, realistic API from day one? This is the problem our **API Simulator** solves. It's a powerful tool that lets you create mock API endpoints instantly, decoupling your development workflows and dramatically accelerating your time to market.

## What is the API Simulator?

The API Simulator is a free, client-side tool that allows you to define custom API endpoints and the JSON responses they should return. It acts as a lightweight, instant mock server that runs directly in your browser, requiring zero setup or deployment.

## How to Create a Mock API in 3 Steps

Setting up a mock endpoint takes just a few seconds.

1.  **Define Your Endpoint:**
    *   Open the **API Simulator** tool.
    *   Specify the request path (e.g., `/users/123`) and the HTTP method (e.g., `GET`).

2.  **Craft Your Response:**
    *   In the response body editor, paste or write the JSON data you want the endpoint to return.
    *   Set the desired HTTP status code (e.g., `200 OK`).
    *   Optionally, add a response delay in milliseconds to simulate network latency.

3.  **Launch and Use:**
    *   Click "Start Simulation".
    *   The tool provides you with a unique base URL. Use this URL in your frontend code to make requests to the endpoint you just defined. For example: `fetch('UNIQUE_URL/users/123')`.
    *   That's it! Your frontend application will now receive the mock data as if it were calling a real backend.
