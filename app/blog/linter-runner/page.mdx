## The Silent Guardian of Code Quality

Linters are automated tools that analyze your source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs. They are like a second pair of eyes that never get tired, helping you maintain a high standard of quality and consistency in your codebase. However, setting up and configuring linters for a project can sometimes be a hassle.

Our **Linter Runner** provides a zero-setup way to run popular linters on any piece of code directly in your browser. It's perfect for quick checks, learning linter rules, or validating a single file without a full project setup.

## What is a Linter and Why Use One?

A linter is a static analysis tool. "Static" means it checks your code without actually running it. It enforces a set of rules, which can range from simple style preferences (like using single vs. double quotes) to complex logic checks (like identifying unreachable code or potential memory leaks).

Using a linter helps you:
*   **Catch Bugs Early:** Find errors before they make it into production.
*   **Improve Readability:** Enforce a consistent style, making the code easier for everyone on the team to read and understand.
*   **Learn Best Practices:** Linter rules are often based on language-specific best practices, helping you become a better developer.

## How to Use the Linter Runner

1.  **Select a Linter:** Choose the appropriate linter for your code (e.g., ESLint for a JavaScript snippet).
2.  **Provide Your Code:** Paste the code you want to check into the editor.
3.  **Configure Rules (Optional):** If you want to test against a specific configuration, paste your `.eslintrc` or other config file content into the configuration panel. Otherwise, the tool will use a standard, recommended ruleset.
4.  **Run and Review:** Click the "Run Linter" button. The tool will process your code and display a list of warnings and errors. Each issue will be linked to the specific line in your code, making it easy to find and fix.
