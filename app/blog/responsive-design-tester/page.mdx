## Does Your Website Break on Mobile?

You've just built a beautiful new landing page. It looks fantastic on your 27-inch monitor. But have you checked it on an iPhone? An Android tablet? A small laptop? In today's multi-device world, a website that isn't responsive is a broken website. Manually resizing your browser window is a slow and inaccurate way to test.

Our **Responsive Design Tester** provides a simple and powerful solution. It allows you to see how your website renders across a variety of common device viewports, all at the same time, in a single dashboard.

## What is a Responsive Design Tester?

A Responsive Design Tester is a tool that displays a given URL in multiple iframes, each sized to match the viewport of a popular device (like an iPhone 14, a Google Pixel, an iPad, and a standard laptop). This allows you to instantly spot layout issues, broken CSS, or unreadable text on different screen sizes without needing to own every device or constantly resize your browser.

## A Common Use Case: Reviewing a New Feature

A frontend developer on your team has just finished a new "pricing" page and has created a pull request. As a reviewer, you need to ensure it looks good on all devices.

1.  **Get the Preview URL:** You get the unique preview URL for the pull request from your deployment service (like Vercel or Netlify).

2.  **Enter it into the Tester:** You paste the URL into the Responsive Design Tester.

3.  **Instant Visual Feedback:** Immediately, you see the pricing page displayed in four different viewports:
    *   **Mobile (390px wide):** You notice that the pricing cards are stacking vertically as expected, but the text inside is too small to read comfortably.
    *   **Tablet (768px wide):** The layout looks good, but a "Sign Up" button is slightly misaligned.
    *   **Laptop (1366px wide):** Looks perfect.
    *   **Desktop (1920px wide):** Looks perfect.

4.  **Provide Specific Feedback:** You can now go back to the pull request and leave precise, actionable feedback: "Looks great overall! Just two things: could you increase the font size on the pricing cards for screens under 480px? Also, the main CTA button on the tablet view seems to be off-center."

5.  **Result:** You've done a thorough responsive design review in under a minute. The developer knows exactly what to fix, and you've prevented a poor user experience from reaching production.

      <p>Responsive bugs are often subtle. A missing `max-width: 100%` on an image or a flexbox container that doesn't wrap correctly can be hard to spot. The tester makes these issues immediately obvious.</p>

## Don't Let Your Users Pinch and Zoom

A great user experience is a responsive user experience. Integrating a quick responsive check into your development and review process is one of the easiest ways to improve the quality of your website or web application.

<div className="text-center my-10">
  <Button asChild size="lg">
    <Link href="/tools/responsive-design-tester">
      <Smartphone className="mr-2 h-5 w-5" /> Test Your Site Now
    </Link>
  </Button>
</div>

Ensure your site is usable and beautiful, no matter the screen size.
