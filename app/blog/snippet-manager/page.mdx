## Stop Reinventing the Wheel

How many times have you written the same utility function, configuration block, or clever algorithm across different projects? Every developer has a personal library of useful code fragments, but they are often scattered across old files, notes, or gists. This disorganization leads to wasted time searching for code you've already written.

Our **Snippet Manager** is a centralized, searchable library for all your personal code snippets. It's designed to help you save, find, and reuse your best code instantly, dramatically boosting your development productivity.

## What is a Snippet Manager?

A snippet manager is a tool that provides a personal database for your code. Instead of letting valuable code fragments get lost in the shuffle of project folders, you can store them in an organized and easily accessible place. It's like having a personal, searchable Stack Overflow tailored to your own solutions.

## A Common Use Case: Storing a Custom React Hook

Imagine you've just written a clever `useDebounce` hook in React that you know you'll need again.

1.  **Create a New Snippet:** Open the Snippet Manager and click "Add Snippet".
2.  **Paste Your Code:** Copy the `useDebounce` hook's code and paste it into the code editor.
3.  **Add Metadata:**
    *   **Title:** `React useDebounce Hook`
    *   **Language:** `JavaScript` (or `TypeScript`)
    *   **Tags:** `react`, `hooks`, `debounce`, `performance`
    *   **Description:** "A custom React hook to debounce a value. Useful for delaying API calls from search inputs."
4.  **Save It:** Click "Save".

The next time you need to debounce an input, instead of rewriting the logic from scratch or hunting through old projects, you can simply search your Snippet Manager for "debounce" and have your battle-tested code ready to go in seconds.
