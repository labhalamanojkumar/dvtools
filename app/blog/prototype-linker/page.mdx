## The Problem with Static Images

You've spent days creating beautiful, pixel-perfect mockups for a new application flow. You present them to stakeholders, but they struggle to understand how it all fits together. "What happens when I click this button?" they ask. "How do I get from this screen to that one?"

Static images can't fully communicate the user experience. To get meaningful feedback, you need to show, not just tell. This is where a **Prototype Linker** comes in. It's a tool that transforms your flat design screens into a simple, interactive, and clickable prototype that simulates the real user flow.

## What is a Prototype Linker?

A prototype linker allows you to upload a series of design images (e.g., exported PNGs from Figma or Sketch) and define "hotspots" on them. A hotspot is a clickable area that links one screen to another. For example, you can draw a hotspot over a "Login" button on your home screen and link it to your dashboard screen.

The result is a shareable web prototype that feels like a real application, allowing users and stakeholders to click through the flow just as they would in the final product.

## How to Create Your First Prototype

1.  **Export Your Screens:** Export all the screens for a single user flow (e.g., a signup process) from your design tool as PNG or JPG files.
2.  **Upload to the Linker:** Create a new project in the Prototype Linker and upload all your screen images.
3.  **Define Hotspots and Link:**
    *   Select your starting screen (e.g., the landing page).
    *   Click and drag to draw a hotspot over the "Sign Up" button.
    *   In the linking dialog, choose the "Sign Up Form" screen as the destination.
    *   Continue this process for all interactive elements: link form fields to the next step, link a "Submit" button to a "Success" screen, etc.
4.  **Share and Get Feedback:** Once your flow is fully linked, click "Share" to get your preview link. Send this link to your team, clients, or test users and ask them to complete the task. Watch them interact with it to gather valuable, real-world feedback.

## Fail Faster, Succeed Sooner

The goal of prototyping is to learn as quickly and cheaply as possible. An interactive prototype is a low-fidelity, high-impact tool that helps you test your assumptions and validate your design decisions. By identifying usability issues at the design stage, you save countless hours of engineering effort and build a better product for your users.
