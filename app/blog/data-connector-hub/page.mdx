## The Challenge of Fragmented Data

In today's digital ecosystem, data is everywhere. Your user information might be in a PostgreSQL database, your sales data in a Salesforce API, and your marketing analytics in Google Analytics. Accessing and combining this fragmented data is a major challenge for developers and analysts, often requiring custom scripts and complex ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines.

The **Data Connector Hub** is a free, low-code tool designed to simplify this process. It provides a centralized interface to connect to various data sources, fetch data, and combine it for analysis or export, all without writing extensive backend code.

## What is a Data Connector Hub?

The Data Connector Hub acts as a universal adapter for your data. It provides a library of pre-built connectors for popular databases, REST APIs, and third-party services. You configure the connection once, and then you can easily query and retrieve data through a simple, unified interface.

## How to Use the Data Connector Hub

1.  **Choose and Configure a Connector:** Select a connector from the library (e.g., "PostgreSQL").
2.  **Enter Your Credentials:** Provide the necessary connection details (e.g., host, username, password, database name). The hub will test the connection.
3.  **Build Your Query:**
    *   For a **SQL database**, write a standard SQL `SELECT` query in the editor.
    *   For a **REST API**, enter the endpoint URL, select the HTTP method, and add any required headers or query parameters.
4.  **Fetch and Preview the Data:** Run the query to fetch the data and see a preview in a table format.
5.  **Combine and Transform (Optional):** Add another data source and define a join key to combine the datasets. For example, join your database users with Salesforce contacts on their email address.
6.  **Export Your Result:** Download the final, unified dataset.
